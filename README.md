**Cosmopilot** is a Kubernetes operator designed to simplify the deployment and management of Cosmos-based blockchain nodes.
It automates tasks like node deployment, upgrades, disk-resize, api exposure, backup (with data integrity validation), ensuring a seamless experience for blockchain operators.

## Key Features

- **Node Deployment**:
    - Deploy nodes based on CRDs: `ChainNode` (single node) and `ChainNodeSet` (group of nodes).
    - Automatically peers nodes from the same network if they are on the same namespace.
    - Automatically generates consensus keys and account private keys when needed, and keeps them in secrets.

- **Persistent Volume Management**:
    - Creates (or imports) and manages Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) for node data.
    - Automatically increases PVC size when usage exceeds a configurable threshold.

- **API Endpoints Exposure**:
    - Integrates with NGINX and cert-manager to optionally expose API endpoints publicly (RPC, LCD, gRPC and EVM).
    - Integrates with [cosmoguard](https://github.com/NibiruChain/cosmoguard) for fine-grained control over API access and caching.

- **Backup and Snapshot Management**:
    - Configurable snapshot frequency and retention policies (with optional node shutdown during snapshot creation).
    - Export snapshots to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as tarball files.
    - Verifies snapshot integrity.

- **Genesis Management**:
    - Retrieve genesis from a URL, ConfigMap, RPC endpoint, or generate a new one (useful for launching testnets).

- **State-Sync Automation**:
    - Automatically configures state-sync between nodes.
    - Simplifies restoring nodes from state-sync snapshots.

- **TMKMS Integration**:
    - Securely manages private keys using TMKMS.
    - Supports HashiCorp Vault as the key provider.

- **Governance Upgrade Automation**:
    - Monitors for governance upgrades with detailed Docker image info.
    - Automatically upgrades nodes without manual intervention.
    - Manual upgrades are also schedulable.
