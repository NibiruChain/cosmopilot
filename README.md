# nibiru-operator
Kubernetes controllers to manage nibiru (and other cosmos nodes) on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Requirements
* Kubernetes cluster v1.29

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

Before deploying, you need to have a `ghcr` secret in the `nibiru-system` namespace

```sh
kubectl create secret docker-registry ghcr --docker-server='ghcr.io' --docker-email='devops@nibiru.org' --docker-username='nibibot' --docker-password='<password>' --namespace='nibiru-system'
```

You can obtain the `<password>` from a `ghcr` secret from another cluster. For example,

```sh
kubectl get secret ghcr -n nibiru-system -o jsonpath='{.data.\.dockerconfigjson}' | base64 --decode
```

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
make install
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push VERSION=<your-tag>
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy VERSION=<your-tag>
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
